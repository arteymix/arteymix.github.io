title: Starting a Consulting Company
---


Here we go. I just registered my new venture, a sole proprietorship named
"Guillaume Poirier-Morency Consulting Co.". It will focus on providing
consulting services in my areas of expertise such as computer science,
programming, bioinformatics, and statistical modelling.

I have a few core ideas:

 - Apply my expertise to help out people make the most out of computer science
   in their projects. That could range from better understanding and explaining
   the challenges underlying their scientific questions to building working
   prototypes and solutions.
 - Use cloud services to power solutions and avoid as much as possible the
   burdens of maintenance.
 - Provide solutions for customers and release as much as possible under free
   software licenses.
 - Use free software for business operations (i.e. GNU Cash, LibreOffice, etc.).

It's also important for me to avoid competing interests with my work and make
sure that I preserve an overall sane work-life balance. To that end, I will pick
projects carefully.

I might also deviate a bit into uncharted territories such as personal income
tax. I've been helping friends and family members recently with their tax
returns, and I know a fair bit about the available deductions, credits, etc. to
help out people.

No logo, graphics, or website yet. Just an idea. That's it.
