I use vim.

I do not remember how difficult was the learning process. Although, I can say I
am more proficient now and it has really changed my approach to programming.

I used to program with [NetBeans IDE](). I never really liked Eclipse as it was
and still is a complex IDE. I favour simplicity, pure and simple.

Vim is fast and has a low memory trace (~8Mb for this post).

I have my own set of plugins that fullfill my needs. I improve it from time to
time or whenever I feel like I need something different. I love autoclosing
parenthesis, syntax coloring, Solarized theme and nice autocompletion.

Neocomplete provides an extraordinary useful completion as it completes:
* filesystem
* used words
* language if it has an omnicomplete

Supertab is a great plugin that remaps <code>C-xC-n</code> to <code>TAB</code> to navigate
through results.

I rather do the code formatting myself. I put a lot of attention to the coding
process, so I want to have control over it all.
