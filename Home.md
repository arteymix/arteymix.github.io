# Arteymix's  blog

I am a passionate web developer. I work with multiple tools and languages on web application.

This blog is about web development. I will mostly talk about [http://kohanaframework.org](the Kohana framework) as it is my main working tool, but I shall write some articles about [http://flask.pocoo.org](Flask). Since I am also a passionate of free software (like in free beer!), it should also host some articles on the matter.

For those who care, my name is a slight modification of the goddess of hunt, Artemis.
