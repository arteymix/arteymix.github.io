# Arteymix's  blog

I am a passionate web developer. I work with multiple tools and languages on web application.

This blog is about web development. I will mostly talk about [the Kohana framework](http://kohanaframework.org) as it is my main working tool, but I shall write some articles about [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org). Since I am also a passionate of free software (like in free beer!), it should also host some articles on the matter.

For those who care, my name is a slight modification of the goddess of hunt, Artemis.
