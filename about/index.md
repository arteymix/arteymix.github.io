Currently, I work as a Bioinformatics Analyst at the Michael Smith Laboratories
(UBC) with Paul Pavlidis. I also offer consulting services on various topics
such as software development, bioinformatics, mathematical modelling, etc.

I offer tailored technical and scientific consulting services covering a broad
range of topics in bioinformatics, computer science and mathematical modelling.

I graduated in Computer Science at [Université de Montréal](http://www.umontreal.ca)
and worked at [IRIC](http://iric.ca/) under François Major. You might want to
take a look at my [_curiculum vitae_](/curiculum-vitae-en.pdf).

This blog essentially treat of Web development, Vala programming for GNOME and
some day-to-day tools for academics.

Although I started with [the Kohana framework](http://kohanaframework.org) and
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), my work quickly dwelved into
[Vala](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala), where I try to create an
ecosystem of libraries to support modern Web development. You can read more
about all this under the [Valum](/valum) category.

I am also a passionate of free software (like in free beer!). Most of my work
is licensed under the LGPLv3.

If you would like to reach me, I have an email address which can be accessed in
