title: About

I am a passionate web developer. I work with multiple tools and languages on web
application.

This blog is about web development. I will mostly talk about
[the Kohana framework](http://kohanaframework.org) as it is my main working
tool, but I will also write some articles about [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org).
Since I am also a passionate of free software (like in free beer!), it should
also host some articles on the matter.

I study Computer Science at [Université de Montréal](http://www.umontreal.ca).
For now, I work at [Hète.ca](http://hete.ca) and on my workgroup
[Pittoresque](https://pittoresque.github.io). I do web development in both
places. You might want to sneak a peek at my
[_curiculum vitae_](/assets/curiculum-vitae.pdf) (beware, it's in french).


If you would like to reach me, I have an email address which can be accessed in
the left column. If you have to send sensitive information, you may use
[GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org) along with my
[public key](/assets/guillaumepoiriermorency.gpg) which id is
<code>B1AD6EA5</code>.

For those who care, my username is a slight modification of the goddess of hunt,
Artemis.

### Some of my work

I've been doing more web-related work, more specifically:

 - [RueDesJuristes](https://ruedesjuristes.com) is a juridic platform which
   connects users with jurists to perform society-related operations.
 - [Valum](https://github.com/valum-framework/valum) is a web micro-framework
   entirely written in the Vala programming language. There's a
   [dedicated category](/valum) to this project in this blog.
