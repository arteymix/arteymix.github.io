I study Computer Science at [Université de Montréal](http://www.umontreal.ca)
and work at [IRIC](http://iric.ca/) for the summer of 2016. You might want to
sneak a peek at my [_curiculum vitae_](/assets/curiculum-vitae.pdf) (beware,
it's in french).

This blog essentially treat of Web development and is entirely based on
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Although I started with [the Kohana framework](http://kohanaframework.org) and
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), my work quickly dwelved into
[Vala](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala), where I try to create an
ecosystem of libraries to support modern Web development.

I am also a passionate of free software (like in free beer!). Most of my work
is licensed under the LGPLv3.

If you would like to reach me, I have an email address which can be accessed in
the left column. If you have to send sensitive information, you may use
[GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org) along with my [public key](/assets/guillaumepoiriermorency.gpg)

For those who care, my username is a slight modification of the goddess of hunt,
Artemis.
