title: About
---

I study Computer Science at [Université de Montréal](http://www.umontreal.ca)
and work at [IRIC](http://iric.ca/) under François Major. You might want to
sneak a peek at my [_curiculum vitae_](/curiculum-vitae.pdf) (beware, it's in
french).

This blog essentially treat of Web development, Vala programming for GNOME and
some day-to-day tools for academics.

Although I started with [the Kohana framework](http://kohanaframework.org) and
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), my work quickly dwelved into
[Vala](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala), where I try to create an
ecosystem of libraries to support modern Web development. You can read more
about all this under the [Valum](/valum) category.

I am also a passionate of free software (like in free beer!). Most of my work
is licensed under the LGPLv3.

If you would like to reach me, I have an email address which can be accessed in
the left column. If you have to send sensitive information, you may use

My username is a slight modification of the goddess of hunt, Artemis.
