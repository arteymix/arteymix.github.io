Valum is a web micro-framework written in the
[Vala programming language](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala). It is
a powerful and minimalistic tool build on VSGI, a middleware that supports
multiple HTTP servers and communication protocols.

The UML diagram describing the internal architecture can be obtained
[here](/valum/valum-class-diagram.svg), it is a SVG generated by
[Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia), an good general purpose diagram editor.
