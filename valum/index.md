Valum is a web micro-framework written in the
[Vala programming language](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala). It is
a powerful and minimalistic tool build on VSGI, a middleware that supports
multiple HTTP servers and communication protocols.

Valum [class diagram](valum-class-diagram.svg) can provide you a good idea of
the internal architecture of the framework. It is a SVG generated by
[Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia), an good general purpose diagram editor.

To have a better understanding of how VSGI processes a client request, you may
consult the [client request processing](client-request-sequence-diagram.svg)
UML sequence diagram.
