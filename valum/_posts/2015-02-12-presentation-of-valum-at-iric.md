I have presented the framework to the IRIC team. They do research in
bio-informatics.

I covered the following points:

 - history of Vala
 - presentation of Valum
 - code examples
 - middleware architecture
 - framework architecture
 - justification
 - objectives
 - application

You can access the [presentation PDF](presentation.pdf) and the
[source in Markdown](presentation.md). It is generated by
[pandoc](http://pandoc.org),
[beamer](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/) and
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/).

Build the template with:
{% highlight bash %}
pandoc -t beamer -V theme:Rochester --latex-engine xelatex -o presentation.pdf presentation.md
{% endhighlight %}
