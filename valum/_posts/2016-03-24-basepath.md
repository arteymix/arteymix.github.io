title: Basepath
---

I have recently introduced a `basepath` middleware and I thought it would be
relevant to describe it further.

It's been possible, since a while, to compose routers using subrouting. This is
very important to write modular applications.

```csharp
var app = new Router ();
var user = new Router ();

user.get ("/user/<int:id>", (req, res, next, ctx) => {
    var id = ctx["id"] as string;
    var user = new User.from_id (id);
    res.extend_utf8 ("Welcome %s", user.username);
});

app.rule ("/user", user.handle);
```

Now, using `basepath`, it's possible to design the `user` router without
specifying the `/user` prefix on rules.

This is very important, because we want to be able to design the `user` router
as if it were the root and rebase it on need upon any prefix.

```csharp
var app = new Router ();
var user = new Router ();

user.get ("/<int:id>", (req, res) => {
    res.extend_utf8 ("Welcome %s".printf (ctx["id"].get_string ()))
});

app.use (basepath ("/user", user.handle));
```

## How it works

When passing through the `basepath` middleware, request which have
a prefix-match with the basepath are stripped and forwarded.

## But there's more!

That's not all! The middleware also handle errors that set the `Location`
header from `Success.CREATED` and `Redirection.*` domains.

```csharp
user.post ("/", (req, res) => {
    throw new Success.CREATED ("/%d", 5); // rewritten as '/user/5'
});
```

It also rewrite the `Location` header if it was set directly.

```csharp
user.post ("/", (req, res) => {
    res.status = Soup.Status.CREATED;
    res.headers.replace ("Location", "/%d".printf (5));
});
```

Rewritting the `Location` header is exclusively applied on absolute paths
starting with a leading  slash `/`.

It can easily be combined with the `subdomain` middleware to provide
a path-based fallback:

```csharp
app.subdomain ("api", api.handle);
app.use (basepath ("/api/v1", api.handle));
```
