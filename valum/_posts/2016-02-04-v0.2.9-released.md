title: v0.2.9 Released!
---

I have just backported important fixes from the latest developments in this
[hotfix release](https://github.com/valum-framework/valum/releases/tag/v0.2.9).

 - fix blocking `accept` call
 - async I/O with FastCGI with `UnixInputStream` and `UnixOutputStream`
 - backlog defaults to `10`

The blocking `accept` call was a real pain to work around, but I finally ended
up with an elegant solution:

 - use a threaded loop for accepting a new request
 - delegate the processing into the main context

FastCGI mutiplexes multiple requests on a single connection and thus, it's hard
to perform efficient asynchronous I/O. The only thing we can do is polling the
unique file descriptor we have and to do it correctly, why not reusing
`gio-unix-2.0`?

The streams are reimplemented by deriving `UnixInputStream` and
`UnixOutputStream` and overriding `read` and `write` to write a record instead
of the raw data. That's it!

I have also been working on SCGI: the netstring processing is now fully
asynchronous. I couldn't backport it as it was depending on other breaking
changes.
