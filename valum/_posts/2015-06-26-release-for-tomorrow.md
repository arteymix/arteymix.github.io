title: Release for tomorrow!
---

Tomorrow, I will be releasing the first version of the 0.2 serie of Valum web
micro-framework.

There's still a couple of tests to make to ensure that everything is working
perfectly and I will distribute the `0.2.0-alpha`.

This serie will target an eventually stable release after which rules will be
enforced to ensure API compatibility. It will definately mark the end of the
last days prototyping.

Good night y'all!
