The project was accepted!

I will officially work on Valum this summer under the direction of
[Fran√ßois Major](http://www.iric.ca/recherche/chercheurs-principaux/francois-major/)
at the IRIC lab.

As part of the evaluation, I will be have the opportunity to demonstrate the
framework potential with an assignment. Also, I am required to keep track of
the project advancements, so keep in touch with the [Valum category](/valum) of
my blog!
