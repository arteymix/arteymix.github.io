I offer consulting on a variety of subjects including bioinformatics, software
programming, and mathematical modelling. I operate in Vancouver BC for in-person
meetings.

I am well versed in C, Python and Java programming languages, data sciences,
statistics, web programming, and other useful skills turn challenging problems
into working solutions.

Few highlights:

 - Genomic and transcriptomic data analysis
 - Statistical modelling (counting models, regression, non-linear fit,
 dimensionality reduction, etc.)
 - Mathematical modelling with PDE
 - Web programming in Python (Flask or Django) and Java (Spring)
 - Figures, everyone needs them
 - Cloud computing solution that require no physical infrastructure (Google
   Cloud Platform, AWS)
