You can reach me to consult on a variety of subjects including bioinformatics,
software programming, and mathematical modelling. I operate in Vancouver BC.

I am well versed in C, Python and Java programming languages, data sciences,
statistics, web programming, and other useful skills to move on from a
challenging problem to a working solution.

Few highlights:

 - Genomic and transcriptomic data analysis
 - Statistical modelling (counting models, regression, non-linear fit,
 dimensionality reduction, etc.)
 - Mathematical modelling with PDE
 - Web programming in Python (Flask or Django) and Java (Spring)
 - Figures, everyone needs them
 - Cloud computing solution that require no physical infrastructure (Google
   Cloud Platform, AWS)

The best way to reach me is via my personal email -- it's in the sidebar.
