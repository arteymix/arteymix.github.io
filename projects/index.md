There are a couple of projects I work on at the moment.

µHTTP over SMS
--------------
I plan, with the collaboration of some friends, to implement a simplified HTTP
protocol for communicating on Internet through SMS. The specifications of µHTTP
are still under development and a draft is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/arteymix/micro-http).
