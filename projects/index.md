There are a couple of projects I work on at the moment.

µHTTP over SMS
--------------
I plan, with the collaboration of some friends, to implement a simplified HTTP
protocol for communicating on Internet through SMS. The specifications of µHTTP
are still under development and a draft is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/arteymix/micro-http).

Valum
-----
Valum is a web micro-framework that provides a basic router and request-response
abstractions. The project is initiated by [@antono](https://github.com/antono)
and [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/antono/valum).

I intend to

 - build a SGI for Vala based on Soup and Gee
 - support FastCGI
 - reverse URI
 - deploy a real application
